# Console Log Cleanup Summary

## Date: 2025-07-21

## Overview
Cleaned up console logs throughout the codebase in preparation for production deployment. The focus was on removing debug logging while retaining critical error logging with proper error handling.

## Files Modified

### React Components
1. **components/command-palette/command-palette.tsx**
   - Removed debug logs for component mounting, props, and command generation
   - Retained error logging for AI recommendation failures

2. **components/issues/issues-list.tsx**
   - Removed performance tracking logs (cache hit/miss, load times)
   - Retained error logging for search and fetch operations

3. **components/issues/issue-details.tsx**
   - Removed performance tracking logs
   - Retained error logging for status and type updates

4. **components/issues/create-issue-modal.tsx**
   - Removed debug logs for prompt generation
   - Fixed unused error variable warning

5. **components/issues/edit-issue-modal.tsx**
   - Fixed unused error variable warning

6. **components/layout/app-command-palette.tsx**
   - Removed debug log for fetched issue

7. **hooks/use-global-shortcuts.tsx**
   - Removed status change debug logs
   - Retained error logging for status update failures

8. **components/cookbook/recipe-details.tsx**
   - Retained error logging for clipboard operations

### Context Providers
1. **contexts/issue-cache-context.tsx**
   - Removed all cache performance logs (hydration, hit/miss, load times)
   - Removed unused timing variables
   - Retained error logging for critical failures

### Library Modules
1. **lib/llm/issue-recommender.ts**
   - Removed debug logs for UUID validation and matching
   - Fixed unused parameter warnings with underscore prefix
   - Retained error logging for API failures

2. **lib/keyboard/keyboard-manager.ts**
   - Debug logs are already wrapped in debug mode checks (no changes needed)

### Demo Pages
1. **app/demo/prompt-generation/page.tsx**
   - Removed debug log for issue creation

2. **app/demo/edit-issue/page.tsx**
   - Removed debug log for issue update

### Test Setup
- **test/setup.js**: Console mocking configuration left unchanged (needed for tests)

## Types of Logs Removed
1. **Performance Tracking**: Cache hit/miss rates, load times, hydration times
2. **Debug Information**: Component mounting, props logging, state changes
3. **Development Helpers**: UUID validation, LLM response debugging

## Types of Logs Retained
1. **Error Handling**: All console.error statements with proper error context
2. **Security Warnings**: Console.warn statements (wrapped in conditions)
3. **Test Infrastructure**: Test setup console mocking

## Verification Steps Completed
1. ✅ ESLint checks passed (with expected warnings)
2. ✅ TypeScript type checking passed
3. ✅ Production build completed successfully
4. ✅ No runtime functionality affected

## Recommendations
1. Consider implementing a proper logging service (e.g., Sentry, LogRocket) for production error tracking
2. Add environment-based logging levels for development vs production
3. Consider using a debug library for conditional logging during development

## Build Output
```
✓ Compiled successfully
✓ Type checking passed
✓ Static pages generated (17/17)
✓ Build optimization completed
```
