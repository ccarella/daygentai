# CSP Migration Tracking

This document tracks the migration from unsafe CSP directives to nonce-based CSP.

## Current Status: Phase 1 - Preparation

### Why This Migration Is Important
- `'unsafe-inline'` and `'unsafe-eval'` significantly weaken XSS protection
- These directives allow any inline script/style to execute
- Nonce-based CSP provides much stronger security guarantees

### Blockers
1. **Next.js Requirements**
   - Hydration scripts are injected inline
   - No built-in nonce support in App Router (as of Next.js 15)
   - Development mode requires eval() for HMR

2. **Third-party Dependencies**
   - Tailwind CSS inline styles
   - React DevTools inline scripts
   - Potential eval() usage in dependencies

### Action Items
- [ ] Audit all inline script usage in the codebase
- [ ] Create inventory of third-party libraries using eval()
- [ ] Set up CSP violation reporting endpoint
- [ ] Research Next.js nonce implementation patterns
- [ ] Create proof-of-concept with nonce-based CSP

- Phase 2 (Q1 2025): Implement nonce generation
- Phase 3 (Q2 2025): Update application code
- Phase 4 (Q3 2025): Testing and gradual rollout
- Phase 5 (Q4 2025): Full production deployment
